➺ Two Projects : 1. Financial Analytics and 2. Employee Attrition Analysis

1. Financial Analysis:
👉 Financial analysis is a crucial aspect of understanding the economic health and performance of companies. It involves evaluating financial data to make informed decisions, assess stability, and predict future performance. This analysis typically focuses on various financial metrics, including market capitalization, sales, profitability, and other key indicators.
👉 By analyzing this data, we aim to uncover trends, assess company performance, and provide insights into the overall financial landscape of India's leading companies. This analysis can help investors, stakeholders, and analysts make data-driven decisions and strategies.
 
2. Employee Attrition Analysis 
👉 Employee attrition analysis is a crucial aspect of human resource management that involves examining the patterns and causes of employee turnover within an organization. By analyzing data related to employee demographics, performance, engagement, and exit interviews, businesses can identify trends and underlying factors contributing to attrition.
👉 This analysis helps in developing strategies to improve employee retention, reduce turnover costs, and enhance overall organizational performance.
➡️ Through effective use of tools like Excel and Power BI, actionable insights can be derived to support decision-making and foster a more stable and satisfied workforce.
